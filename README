3D Human Pose Estimation = 2D Pose + Matching

This package matlab code demo the 3D human pose estimation form single RGB image with given 2D pose landmarks. The 2D pose can be derived by state-of-the-art CNN such as CPM (https://github.com/shihenw/convolutional-pose-machines-release) or Hourglass

Download the 3D pose library from the following link:

Usage:
 1. Implement a 2D pose estimation approach (ex. CPM or Hourglass)
 2. Open Matlab, set and include current directory to "Release"
 3. Run demo.m (few examples are provided with associated 2D pose by CPM)
 4. Test your own image: Change the input image in demo.m (line 26) and load your own 2D pose estimation (line 32)
